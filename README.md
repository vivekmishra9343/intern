   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/user-form
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
